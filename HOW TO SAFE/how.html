            <h1>LIFE ON LAND </h1>
            <p>The life on earth that is meant here is the life of living organisms such as animals and plants, as animals help to build life, as they are food for humans and plants. At the same time, it maintains a natural balance, because it feeds on other animals and plants. This balance is important in nature, and it's called the life cycle.
                Humans may not be able to live without the help of animals. The role it plays in maintaining the natural balance is a valuable service to humanity. In addition, animals provide humans with a number of different foods, such as meat, milk, eggs, honey, and useful products such as wool, fur and silk.

It also killed or displaced animals that were attacking or hindering land reclamation. Today, man seeks to protect many species of animals, which they once exposed to the threat of extinction. The plant also has many benefits. The plant provides humans with many things. It is a useful productive organism. Among the most important things that it can provide are the following: The plant is the main food source for humans; If he does not feed on it directly, then man will feed on other living creatures that feed on plants<p>
