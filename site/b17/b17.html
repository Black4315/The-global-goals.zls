    <h1>PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS</h1> 
<p><b>Goal 17:</b>of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 17 or Global Goal 17) is centered around “Partnerships for the Goals”. It is one of the seventeen sustainable development goals set by the United Nations in 2015, and the official wording is: “Strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.” The goal includes 17 targets to be achieved by 2030, divided into five categories: finance, technology, capacity building, trade and systemic issues. Progress towards goals is measured by 25 indicators.

    Partnerships and the Goals refers to the need for collaboration across sectors and across countries to achieve all the Goals by 2030, and is a call for countries to align policies. SDG 17 is a vision for improved and fairer trade, as well as coordinated investment initiatives to promote sustainable development across borders. It is about strengthening and simplifying cooperation between nation states, developed or developing, using the Sustainable Development Goals as a common framework and a common vision, to determine the way to achieve this cooperative progress, and seek to enhance international trade, and help developing countries increase their exports to ensure a fair and global rules-based trading system To be fair, open and beneficial to all.

<P>"The success of the 2030 Agenda requires comprehensive partnerships to achieve the approved common goals. These partnerships must be created according to different target groups (local, national, regional and global level) and take into account the principles, vision and values of the SDGs to put people and planet first now more than ever, to recover from the sanitation crisis and rebuild while achieving the SDGs.</P>
