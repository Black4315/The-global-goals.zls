    <h1>GENDER EQUALITY</h1> 
<p><b>Goal 5:</b> Gender equality is the equality between men and women and ensures the concept that we are all human. Men and women are free to develop their own capacities and make decisions without boundaries drawn by stereotyped ideas. Gender equality means that the different behaviours, aspirations and needs of women and men must be taken into account, valued and favored equally. This does not mean that men and women should be the same but that their rights, responsibilities and opportunities do not depend on their gender. Gender equality means fair treatment between men and women according to their own needs. This can include equality of treatment or different treatment but concern for equality of rights, benefits, duties and opportunities.
