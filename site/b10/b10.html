<p><b>Goal 10:</b>The goal has 10 targets to be achieved by 2030. Progress towards the goals is measured through indicators. The first seven are “final goals”: ​​reduce income inequality, promote inclusive social, economic and political inclusion, ensure equal opportunities and end discrimination, adopt financial and social policies that promote equality, improve regulation of global financial markets and institutions, and enhance representation of developing countries in financial institutions, Immigration policies are well managed and responsibly.

    The other three goals are “way to achieve” the goals: special and differential treatment for developing countries, promotion of development assistance and investment in LDCs, and reduction of transaction costs for migrant remittances.
